    "*Speaking for me,* I'm no expert in HAR with deep-learning.\n",
    "That's why I did some research over already existing projects and tutorials (there are quite some.)\n",

    "\n",
    "* _Data-Extraction/Generation and Pre-Processing:_ Standardize, Normalize, Batching-fct., etc.\n",
    "* _The Model:_ Maybe Embedded Layer (Dim. Reduction), LSTMs, Linear-Layer, etc.\n",
    "* _The Training:_ Training loops, visualization\n",
    "* _Validation and Testing:_ finding best hyperparams (Validation), test-loops, check-points\n",
